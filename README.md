# Community V-Slice Modding Template
A basic template with information on the various things scriptable in the FNF V-Slice update.
If you have anything you'd like to add, do a PR or send in an issue!

# Organization
Scripts can be put anywhere in the mod, as long as it extends the correct classes (Module, Song, NoteStyle, etc).
They all should have the ".hxc" file format. They are all a modified version of HScript, allowing uses of regular imports, classes, exports, etcetera.
Assets are organized as per usual asset organization (assets/images, assets/shared/images, etc)

For sake of the template, all scripts will be organized in a scripts folder, except for the main Module class.
